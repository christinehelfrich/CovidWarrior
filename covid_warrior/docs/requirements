------------------------------------------------------------
What program are we going to create?
------------------------------------------------------------
A space invaders clone with similar mechanics and different
game assets. The theme will be closly tied to the 
coronavirus with masks, Karen, virus particles and even
hand sanitizer. 

------------------------------------------------------------
What technologies will we use?
------------------------------------------------------------
- Python
- Arcade
- Git
- Math
- Random

------------------------------------------------------------
What features will we include?
------------------------------------------------------------
We will include similar mechanics to Space Invaders, but instead
we put in a fun twist incorperating a manager trying to prevent 
the spread of covid. The manager will shoot masks, and hand 
sanitizer to prevent the enemies which will be Karens and
the virus.

------------------------------------------------------------
What is your timeline?

Program will be finalized by the due date. The images used 
in the game will be designed by March 6, 2021. The shooting
and hero character actions will be functioning by March 13, 2021.
