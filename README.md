# COVID Warrior vs the Evil Karenites
---
In this Space Invader's clone, the hero is tasked with fighting off the 
Coronavirus and an army of angry Karens. As the Karens and virus move
towards the hero, they must fire WHO approved masks at the Karens and
squirts of hand sanitizer at the virus particles. 

If the virus makes it to the Hero then he has to quarantine for two weeks 
and the game is over. If a karen makes it to the end of the screen without
 a mask then they talk to the manager and you lose the game. 

The player advances to the next round after masking all of the Karens and 
defeating all virus particles.
